InterMOO
========

The InterMOO Channel System links multiple MOOs together through a common chat channel

Please see the header inside the main install file for instructions on installation procedures. 

--------------

ICSInstallFooCore.txt = If your MOO is of a FooCore base, use this version as it supports the @ninja system for hiding players on the WHO listing. 

ICSInstallAnsiNoNinja.txt = use this if your MOO has ANSI color but is not based on FooCore as the @ninja system is omitted from the code.

ICSInstallNoAnsiNoNinja.txt = If you MOO does not have ANSI color, use this. If you're using LambdaCore, this version is for you.
